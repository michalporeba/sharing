## Docker and the Microsoft Stack

Are you a Microsoft stack developer (.net, C#, SQL Server) who would love to join the docker revolution, run your services in containers? Most of us do, but what if your serious sysadmin tells you she will not let you run on Linux. Or the grumpy DBA tells you that it's fine, but only as long as you use windows authentication from those containers (which you cannot).

You know what? That's OK. There are many ways to make it work and I want to show you how. Let's talk about Windows (and Linux) containers on Windows Domain with Active Directory. I would like to show you how to run SQL Server in a container (on Windows or Linux), and how to connect from a container service to windows domain resources (including SQL Server), and more importantly how to convince your infrastructure friends that it is safe to do so. 

After this session, you will know how to run SQL Server in a container as part of your production or development process, but also how to integrate containerised services with an existing Windows domain controlled by Active Directory. 

## Who is this for 

* Microsoft stack developers who want to use docker on windows 

## Why you should attend

* Learn how to run SQL Server in a container
* Learn how to use domain authentication from a container
* Learn how to convince your infrastructure department that it is OK.
