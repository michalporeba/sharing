Michał Poręba is a sort of a DBA who spends more time writing C#, PowerShell, JavaScript
or even Ruby code than SQL queries. Server administration can and should be automated,
performance is best addressed by good system design and implementation, and working with teams
of developers is simply much more fun than spending your days listening to people complaining
the database is not fast enough.

He lives in Wales where he currently works as a Senior SQL Server DBA at Vizolution in Swansea.
In his free time, he speaks obscure languages, plays music with code or dives in local caves 
trying to find places no human has ever been to before. Recently he started blogging at https://dbain.wales.
