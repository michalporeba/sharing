Michał Poręba is a sort of a DBA who spends more of his time writing C#, PowerShell, JavaScript
or even Ruby code than he does writing SQL queries. Server administration can and should be automated,
performance is best addressed by good system design and implementation, and working with teams
of developers is simply a much more fun way of spending time in an office than looking at Management Studio.

He lives in Wales where he currently works as a Senior SQL Server DBA at Vizolution in Swansea.
In his free time, he speaks obscure languages, plays music with code or dives in local caves 
trying to find places no human has ever been to before. An intermittent blogger at https://dbain.wales,
and a once-in-a-while contributor to a few OSS projects.
