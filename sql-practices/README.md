# The Good, The Bad and The Avoidable

Code quality matters! It matters regardless of the language you use. It matters even when according to the language specification (or paradigm) the code quality doesn't matter. Because, even if the computer doesn't care, even if the 'present you' don't, your colleagues and the 'future you' do. Let me show you why with examples from a language nobody loves, the T-SQL. 

## Abstract

Code quality matters!

You probably have worked with SQL queries before. What was the experience like? Have you ever looked at a piece of SQL and thought... G! that's ugly! Have you seen a query that worked just fine in development but annoyingly not in production, or it used to work for a while, but then started timing out without any change or a warning?

This session is for you! Let's take a hard look at code quality on an example from a language nobody loves, the T-SQL. I will show you some ugly queries and teach you how to transform them into good, clean code, that not only looks right but also performs well.
