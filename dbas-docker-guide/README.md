## SQL DBAs Docker Revolution Survival Guide

It has been two years since SQL Server can run on docker. There has been a lot of excitement but far less adoption. 
Why is that? There are many reasons, but one clearly stands out: problems with integrations with existing systems and especially with windows domains and AD.
And still developers want to build microservices and run them in docker containers and we, as DBAs, need to find ways to support them and their applications. 

If you find yourself in this situation, if you managed SQL Server in Windows domains and you hear developers talking about docker, containers and such, this is the session for you. 
Let me explain what they are talking about and show you in detail what options are available to you and what problems to look out for. Yes, there will be problems, 
quite a few, but I will share my solutions and workarounds, show you how I use SQL Server and containers to support my development and production environments.

(To fully participate in the session you should have basic understanding of windows domains and PowerShell. Docker or Linux knowledge is not necessary).
