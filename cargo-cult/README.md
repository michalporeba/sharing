## SQL Server has joined the cargo cult. You should too!

It is 2019 and it seems like everything is in containers, even SQL Server. 

It feels like every conference in the past year or so must have a talk about SQL Server running on Linux or 
docker containers or both at the same time. And still the most common question I hear asked is: why? Why would you want to run SQL Server on Linux or in a container 
when it is perfectly happy on Windows with no containers? The second most common question is about Windows Authentication and AD, 
a subject carefully avoided by most bloggers and speakers. 

But there are good reasons to use SQL Server on docker. Join me for an entry level talk where I will try to explore the reasons behind containers, why and how you may want to use them as a DBA, how they might help you in your job.
