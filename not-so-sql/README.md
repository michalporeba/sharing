# Not So SQL Anymore 

(add the beginning, the benefit of attending?)

What if I told you that you don't have to choose between SQL or NoSQL any more?
That wouldn't be quite true, but the choice is no longer binary. Some document 
databases offer now features typically associated with relational databases 
and a lot of relational database engines support document types or use techniques 
pioneered by NoSQL giants. The gap between the data models is getting smaller. 

Whether you are a developer who just wants to store JSON objects without worrying 
about schemas and constraints, or perhaps a database administrator frustrated by 
developers putting big blobs of text ignoring all the relational wisdom, join me 
and let's explore what is possible with JSON and XML documents in SQL Server.

## Who is this for

DBAs who want to expand their skillset and learn how to work with document types.
Developers who work with SQL Server but mostly with JSON or XML structures.
