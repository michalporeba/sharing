# Spare Bits

This is the place where I keep loose ideas, spare demo code, unnecessary slides. 
As with everything else in my repositories, should you by accident discover them, 
you are welcome to try to find useful stuff here, but it might be harder here
than in other places. It might be that code in this location is of no use to anybody. 
**You have been warned!**
